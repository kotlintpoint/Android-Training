File handling process of Kotlin relies on java.io.File and also kotlin.io package which comes in default.

import java.io.File

var dataDir = File(“.”) //get the root directory

Writing to Files

resolve() function creates if there is no file or directory in File object’s path parameter or open the file. Then you can use writeText() or appendText() having UTF-8 character set by default.

val file = File(“.”).resolve(“test2.txt”) /*creates test.txt file in root directory of project*/
file.writeText(“This is a test!”)

Reading from Files

readText() function of File class can read all content of the file at once on the otherhand readLines() can handle larger contents by reading line by line.
